# Build a development environment #

It is best to develop using a development environment with an on-prem instance of Splunk SOAR.

User can either download the Splunk SOAR OVA or download the tar.gz file and install on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x or CentOS 7.x.

See resources below on setting up a dev environment:
